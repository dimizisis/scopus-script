# scopus-script

## Description

Script that logs in to scopus (must have account on www.scopus.com) and searches a specific query (for now it is a fix query).
Analyzes documents from query, and returns a dictionary of type:

```
{ #, document_name, source_name, year, author_list, number_of_authors (source), 
average_percentile (source), metrics (source) }
```

for every document

When analyzing is finished, a CSV file is exported, containing all the dictionaries mentioned above (documents with its info)
